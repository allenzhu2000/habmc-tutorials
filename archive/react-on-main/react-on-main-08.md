At this point, you should have a decent understanding of Components, Props, PropTypes, and how to render a React app on the page.
This is a great foundation, and should make it way easier to do more in React. 
That said, React is a complex library, and we didn't even touch things like state or events.
This tutorial alone isn't supposed to make you a React expert, just to get your feet wet, and there's nothing like practice to get better.
Ideas of things to do next:
1. Make it so that we import `renderLeadershipTable` from somewhere in the leadership page folder -- in general, we want to keep the top-level pack to just import statements, assignments to window to make things available globally, and maybe one listener for `turbolinks:load`.
2. Redo the sponsors page in React, just like we redid the leadership page here. This shouldn't need anything beyond what we covered in this tutorial
3. Redo other pages of the main site. React is great because you can use little pieces of it here and there, and don't have to migrate everything at once.

- The official React tutorial: [https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). It came in assuming a little too much prior knowledge for my tastes, but it's a good way to get your feet wet with state (and now that you've had a little more experience, it shouldn't be as confusing).
