As a quick rundown, there area a couple reasons you would want to install Ubuntu onto your system.

1. You aren't masochistic
2. You're interested in using docker without Windows Enterprise
3. You want a spicy OS

As a disclamer, all of the following files are probably viruses, good luck.

# To Ubuntu or Not to Ubuntu

Shit gets interesting here, you have two options and each has an inverse amount of overhead on your system versus physical headache. Here's a quick run down of the pros and cons of both methods:

### Virtual Machines, Made With Virtual Love

Pros:
- Easy to setup
- Steps can be done concurrently (Less inital time usage)
- Requires no external process
- Your current progress and programs can be saved without using RAM
- Near impossible for security problems to affect your main system
- You can't accidentally delete System32

Cons:
- High overhead
- Slower run environment
- Shares system resources with base machine
- Murders your battery and doesn't attend the funeral

### Dual Boot

Pros:
- Double the OS, double the power
- You can use ubuntu programs natively
- Resources are dedicated to one system at a time

Cons:
- Requires a flash drive to set up
- Takes much more time to set up
- Processes that happen exist on your hard drive instead of a contained image

# Recap

If you're unsure which to go with, the dual boot is superior in almost every aspect aside from user-friendliness in set up. However, this guide is here to help you with that, so no need to worry.
