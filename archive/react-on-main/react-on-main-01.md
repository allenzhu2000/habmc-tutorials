# Adding React to the main site
This isn't a normal tutorial. 
First of all, the code isn't tested, but more importantly, it describes a task that we want in our codebase. 
That means that by the time you're reading this, it might already have been completed -- but by that time hopefully there will be a real React tutorial anyway.

This tutorial explains how to add React to the main site, and rewrite a few simple components.
You should already have HABMC running on your computer. 
To make sure you see the main site, instead of HABMC, go to [http://localhost:3000/domains/main](http://localhost:3000/domains/main).

Once you see something that looks like [https://stanfordssi.org](https://stanfordssi.org), continue on to the [Next Step](react-on-main-02.md)
