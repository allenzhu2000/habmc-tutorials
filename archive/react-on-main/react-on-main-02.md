# Making the pack
First step, we need a _pack_. 
The pack is a bundle of all the javascript files we write.
It tells the servers to where to get the code from.
The servers -- via a tool called webpack -- then take this pack file, translate it to old javascript for compatibility, and minify it (make it small by doing things like replacing `var longName = 3` with `var a=3`).

Let's create a new file, `main.js.jsx` in `app/javascript/packs`. 
So that we know it was loaded correctly, make the contents:
```jsx harmony
console.log("Hello from the main pack!");
```

We also need to make sure that this pack gets included.
Rails uses _layouts_ for common code across a whole set of views.
This is where we have the HTML for things like our menu bar, but it's also where we can add javascript.
In `app/views/layouts/main.html.erb`, just under the line that has `javascript_include_tag` on it, add:
```
<%= javascript_pack_tag 'main' %>
```

This is a Rails built in that turns the pack we made into a normal `<script>` tag. 
We're going to be making our pack much more complex in a moment, so this will be really handy.

Test it out by going to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and opening up the javascript console.
If it doesn't say "Hello from the main pack!" we've done something wrong.

# Laying the ground work for our React app
Let's back up half a step, and talk about what React does.
React is a javascript library for making complex interfaces by creating reusable bits of interface and giving you the ability to string them together.
We'll get to how React does this in a moment, but React needs to know where to put whatever complex interface you created.
That's why we need an element called the _React root element_.
This is just an empty element on the page, usually a `<div></div>`, that you pass in to React.
React then fills your root element with all the HTML for whatever complex interface you specified.

Let's make a React root element in `app/views/static/main/leadership.html.erb`.
Replace all of this code:
```html
<script type="text/html" id="cell-template">
  <td>
    <div class="uk-border-circle leader-picture">
      <a class="uk-border-circle" href="[[url]]">
        <img src="[[image]]" alt="[[name]]" />
        <div class="overlay">
          <div style="margin-top:[[marginTop]]; text-align:center;">
            <p class="leader-name">[[name]]</p>
            <p class="leader-role">[[role]]</p>
            <p class="leader-email">[[email]]</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </a>
    </div>
  </td>
</script>

<table style="width: 100%" cellpadding="10" id="leadership-table">
</table>
```

With just this:
```html
<div id="leadership-react-root"></div>
```

This is where the HTML generated by React will go.
